## Installation
Links for those who already know how to run and install scripts on computercraft:
The scripts will tell you what you need but, in doubt, you can continue scrolling.
[Server script](https://pastebin.com/Xbn0fpKt)  
[Client script](https://pastebin.com/ZHgSJitZ)

### Server side
Place a computer on your minecraft world.  
Place next to it these peripherals:
- Modem (preferably, the Ender modem)
- Recipe registry
- Informative registry

This is an example:  
![server_setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f615a3-f233-4e42-946e-c45a34fe52ad)

Now, right click the computer and paste this link for an express install: pastebin get https://pastebin.com/Xbn0fpKt startup.lua  
Then, restart the computer. You can press the red button on the left of the computer screen.  
The server side should be done and running correctly.

### Client side
Place a turle on your minecraft world (Not the animal, the computercraft machine!)

The turtle has two inventory spaces next to the 16 slots it already has.
Put in those two slots a crafting table and a modem (preferably, the Ender modem)  
Something like this:  
![client_setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b2fac43-cddc-400f-b765-8bafbffaa993)  

Right click the turtle and paste this link for an express install: pastebin get https://pastebin.com/ZHgSJitZ startup.lua  
Then, restart the computer. You can press the red button on the left of the computer screen.  

## Client navigation

Here, you have to move using the arrow keys (No mouse suport, sorry, but the compatibility with metal tier 1 computers was more important)  
Characters (Write and execute a filter search)  
Backspace key (Delete a character from your filter search)  
Arrow left/right keys (Move filter search cursor)  

Arrow up/down keys (Move selection)  
PageUp/PageDown keys (Previous/Next items page)  
Home/End keys (Start/End of the items list)  
Enter key (Confirm item selection and advance to next screen)
